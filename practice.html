        <h2>Wolves</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Wolves are some of the most iconic predators in the animal kingdom. They‚Äôre featured in songs, legends, and even modern films. Although the gray wolf is the most recognizable, there are more than 30 distinct subspecies that range across the northern hemisphere. These dedicated pack animals hunt together, roam together, and play together, all while maintaining an important role in their local ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>Arcitic Wolf</h3>
            <p>Heading to slightly colder climes, we find the Arctic wolf. This specimen only lives in Canada and Greenland. Its size is smaller than that of other wolves, weighing around 45 kilos in most cases. As a way of adapting to its cold environment, the Arctic wolf has a white to yellowish coat which allows them to blend more easily into their surroundings. The Arctic wolf is a subspecies of the gray wolf.</p>
